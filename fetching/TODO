1. Model the case when the message may arrive multiple times.
   Maybe just don't delete the messages from the set of sent messages
   when they are delivered?
2. Model the seen state.
3. Model UIDVALIDITY reset at arbitrary times.
4. Model reception of message deletion and flags changes when device is offline?
   Deletion: https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/issues/1332
   Maybe not needed, because it can randomly fail when we are offline, so it cannot be relied on anyway.
